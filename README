Creative Commons Firefox Add-on
===============================

The Creative Commons Firefox Add-on (CC-FX) adds support for
displaying license and attribution information for works as you
browse. If the page or items on the page are licensed, a CC icon will
appear in the URL bar, which can be clicked to display the author and
license information (if available).

This add-on is the successor to
[MozCC](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/MozCC) and was initially
developed with support from Google Summer of Code.
